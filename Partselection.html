        <table>
          <tr><p>
              The first thing you want to ask yourself is what are you going to do with this computer are you gaming, are you streaming,
              </p></tr>
            <tr><p>or are you just doing office work Because what you want your computer to do will dictate your price and what parts you might</p></tr>
          <tr><p>want to invest more money into. I am going to be focusing on a gaming PC becuase that is what most people build computert for.</p></tr>      
        <tr><p>When choosing parts for a gaming pc you want to look at what your price point is and what games you are going to be playing</p></tr>
            <tr><p>like if you are playing AAA titles you might want to go with a higher end system.But if all you want to do is play minecraft</p></tr>

                  <tr><p>one part is way better than the other the worse part might slow down the faster part.</p></tr>
        </table>
          <h2>Part choice</h2>
          <p>When choosing the parts you want to get a cpu and a motherboard that are compatible with each other.</p>
          <p>If you choose a CPU that does not match the motherboard the CPU will not fit and will not work with </p>
          <p>your motherboard. I recommend using <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/">PCPartPicker</a> because you can choose all the parts you</p>
          <p>want to use in your computer and it will show incompatibilities and issues with the parts you chose if there are any. It will</p>
          <p>also show you the price of the system and where the best price for the part looking for at what store.</p>
          <h2>CPU Choice</h2>
          <p>When choosing a CPU you want to know are you going to be doing any CPU intensive task like video editing and streaming.</p>
          <p>Or are you just going to be working with word and browsing the web. Also when choosing the CPU are you going to use </p>
          <p>applications that can use multiple CPU cores like, editing and streaming or are you doing something like gaming that uses mainly</p>
          <p>single core power. This will heavily influence the brand you want to choose and the GPU you go with. Intel and AMD also make CPUs</p>
          <p>servers and they can get exspensive to say the least. They are ussualy high core and thread count proccesers and they run slow.</p>
          <p>Intel calls there server CPUs Xeon and AMD calls there Epyc, they can start at around 1000$ and reach 10000$ and that is not including</p>
          <p>the special motherboards you have to buy for them that cost 1000$ alone aswell. They both also offer worksation CPUs that also have</p>
          <p>high core and thread counts there is not much of a diffrence but Xeon and epyc go into higher core count and there made for servers.</p>
          <p>Intel calls there lineup I9 Intel extreme and AMD calls there lineup threadripper they range from 500$-1800$ and AMD stops at 1000$ </p>

          <h2>GPU Selection</h2>
          <p>When choosing your GPU it's pretty simple, what are you doing, because if you are just searcing the web you probably</p>
          <p>won't need invest much into you GPU and may even getting away with integrated graphics in you CPU.</p>
          <p>But if you are gaming or 3D modeling this is where most of your budget is going. If it is a personal rig </p>
          <p>you will probbaly want to go with more consumer freindly cards like the geforce gtx or fx grapichs cards. But if you are build</p>
          <p>a 3D modeling rig you will want to go with a workstation level card like the quadro lineup from Nividia</p>
          <img src="Quadro%20p6000.jpg">
          <p style="color:red; text-decoration: underline">https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/design-visualization/QuadroStore/nvidia-quadro-p6000-front.jpg</p>
          <p>Quadro's can range from 1000$ to 10000$ they dont differ to much from the regular lineup but they are built and qulity tested to perfection </p>
          <p>they also have other capabilities that you would use like NVLink which lets you use multiple at a time and many other things.</p>
          <h2>Storage</h2>
          <p>when choosing storage there are 2 main options you can go with, Hard Drive or SSD(Solid State Drive)</p>
          
          <p>a hard drive is ussualy cheaper,has a larger storage capacity an SSD is more exspensive and tends to be</p>
          <p>much lower capacity.The thing about an SSD is that its worlds faster than a Hard Drive and there is no moving parts.</p>
          <p>when choosing the storage if you have the budget to an include an SSD then it is a good option but it is not</p>
          <p>required. If you do get an SSD it will be where you want to install the OS(Operating System). You can have </p>
          <p>both in one system so when you install the OS on the SSD the Hard Drive will be used for large files that</p>
          <p>that you won't be accesing all the time like videos and pictures.</p>
          <img src="Hard%20Drive.jpg">
          <img src="SSD.jpg">
          <p style="color:red; text-decoration: underline">https://www.bhphotovideo.com/images/images2500x2500/western_digital_wd10ezex_1tb_wd_caviar_blue_903174.jpg</p>
          <p style="color:red; text-decoration: underline">https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-XZNr7mS0iw/maxresdefault.jpg</p>
          <p>There is 2 other types of storage but they are not used much because they are exspensive but they both SSDs</p>
          <p>but they use a diffrent connection then the regular SSD that uses SATA Data cable. The first one an M.2 SSD</p>
          <p>uses the M.2 slot on your motherboard</p>
          <img src="M.2%20motherboard.jpg">
          <p style="color:red; text-decoration: underline">http://thessdreviewcdn2.thessdreview1.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ASRock-X99-Extreme11-Motherboard-M.2-slots.jpg</p>
          <p>An M.2 is small but very fast and they are increasing in popularity becuase there price is going down. The </p>
          <p>other storage part is an SSD aswell, but instead if using the SATA or M.2 it uses your PCI-E slot that a GPU </p>
          <p>would use.</p>
          <img src="pci%20ssd.jpg">
          <p style="color:red; text-decoration: underline">https://techreport.com/r.x/freshstorage/p3700.jpg</p>
          <p>it is also very fast much faster than a SATA SSD and has the advantage of having GB/s read and write speeds.</p>
          <h2>RAM</h2>
          <p>RAM is pretty straight forward if you are gaming 16gb of ram will probably be enough in 2018. If you are streaming and editing 32 or 64gb</p>
          <p>would be really good.If you are just using your computer for web browsing 8gb will probably be enough. </p>
          <img src="RAM.jpg">
          <p style="color:red; text-decoration: underline">https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41AGvSmY-fL._SX425_.jpg</p>
          <p>One thing about choosing RAM is you want to keep in mind what company your CPU is from because AMD processers really</p>
          <p>like fast RAM and you will get max performance out of your CPU.</p>
          <h2>Motherboard</h2>
          <p>when choosing your motherboard it all comes down to what parts you have chose and if you want to overclock or not.</p>
          <p>For the most part there are 2 or 3 sets of motherboards that a CPU usually has a low end that has the bare minimum for</p>
          <p>the computer. The middle of the road that has better features and also includes more USBs on the back IO and SATA plugs</p>
          <p>for the storage. And the highend which is loaded with features and has everything you will need. Sometimes there is no </p>
          <p>high end or low end. The middle is where you can get an unlocked motherboard for overclocking you CPU. The high has all</p>
          <p>that and more features like RGB lighting and WIFI connectibility. Also the higher you go the more RAM slots and more SATA </p>
          <p>slots there are, this also gets more depending on how high end the CPU is.They can come with screens that show problems and temps aswell.</p>
          <img src="Motherboard.jpg">
           <p style="color:red; text-decoration: underline">https://images10.newegg.com/NeweggImage/ProductImageCompressAll1280/13-119-017-V01.jpg</p>  
          <p>When choosing you obviously want to get a motherboard that will suit your needs and also one that is compadible with your CPU.</p>
          <p>You also want to see what kind of memory your RAM uses, most new ones use DDR4 but some can use DDR3 memory(DDR and the number is generation).</p>
          <h2>Power supply</h2>
          <p>The power supply is one of the main parts you do not want to skip out on. This will be suppling your computer with</p>
          <p>power and so for obvious reasons you do not want to get a cheap power supply. When choosing what power supply you are </p>
          <p>gonna want to choose based on needs like do you want to get a modular power supply (where you choose what power cables</p>
          <p>you want to plug in and it looks better), or how high of a watage do you want your power supply to be. so you can supply</p>
          <p>enough power to your PC parts. Dont choose something that is to over kill though because it can just be a waist of money.</p>
          <p>The best way to tell if the power supply is trustworthy is if its 80 plus certified which will also tell you how </p>
          <p> power efficent the power supply is. </p>

          <h2>Chassis and Cooling</h2>
          <p>Case and cooling go hand in hand because the amount of airflow your case has will limit your cooling. There are 2</p>
          <p>different kinds of cooling that are practical water cooling and air cooling. Air cooling is the easiest and you are  </p>
          <p>least likey to have problems with air.But the down side is that it doesnt cool as well as a water cooler would do.</p>
          <P>There are also 2 types of water coolers coustom water loop and an AIO (all in one). A coustom water cooler is a water </P>
          <p>cooling loop where you set up all the tubes your self and fill it with your own coolant. An AIO just comes in a box.</p>
          <p>The tubes are already connected from a water block into a radiator and its basically plug and play.</p>
          <img src="AIO.jpg">
          <img src="Water%20cooled%20pc.jpg">
            <p style="color:red; text-decoration: underline">https://images10.newegg.com/NeweggImage/ProductImageCompressAll1280/35-181-139%20%2001.jpg</p>
            <p style="color:red; text-decoration: underline">https://www.performancepsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/budget-water-cooling-setup-1024x576.jpg</p>
          <p>Air cooling is very simple, all you basically need the thermal paste and then depending on how the air cooler.</p>
          <p>mounts, its typlicly easy to install an air cooler. </p>
          <img src="Pure%20Rock.jpg">
          <p style="color:red; text-decoration: underline">https://www.bequiet.com/en/cpucooler/pure-rock/795</p>
          <p>The case is a very important part of your computer because depending on what size case and what kind of case you get </p>
          <p>will determine what size of parts you want to by and it will also determine what kind of cooling performance you will get.</p>
