            <h2></h2>
            <p>The first thing you want to know about a PC is what the parts do and how they work. This page will explain most of that simplefied</p>
           <h2>The CPU</h2>
            <p>The CPU is the part of the computer that controls everthing it is bassicly the brain of the computer.</p>
           
            <p>The CPU takes inputs from the computer’s RAM and processes the action, before delivering an output.
            <p>CPUs are in all sorts of devices ranging from computers and laptops, to smartphones, and tablets.</p>
           
            <p>The chip is placed onto the device’s motherboard and interacts with the other hardware to operate your computer.</p>

               https://icdn9.digitaltrends.com/image/amd-ryzen-7-cpu-insocket1-2-1500x1000.jpg</p>
           <h2>The GPU</h2>
           <p>The GPU also known as the grapichs processing unit is a specialized chip made to accelerate the creation of an image.</p>
           <p>It is a single-chip processor that creates effects and transforms objects every time a 3D scene is redrawn. </p>
           <p>You can have a dedicated GPU for your computer but some have them integrated in the CPU.</p>
           <p>The GPU is mainly used in applications like 3D modeling and gaming.</p>
           <img src="GV100.jpg">
           <p style="color:red; text-decoration: underline">https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/quadro-store/?nvid=nv-int-qrg0nt-35291</p>
           <p>Most GPUs will come with a cooler on them because when they are working they produce lots of heat.</p>
           <img src="Titannocooler.jpg">
           <p style="color:red; text-decoration: underline">https://www.anandtech.com/show/6760/nvidias-geforce-gtx-titan-part-1/3</p>
           <p>this is what is looks like when you take the cooler off of the GPU.</p>
           <h2>The RAM</h2>
           <p>Known as RAM(Random Access Memory) is the fast memory of the computer. It temporarily stores and</p>
           <p>is working memory for your computer. The more memory the more information your computer can work with at one time.</p>
           <img src="RAM.jpg">
            <p style="color:red; text-decoration: underline">https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41AGvSmY-fL._SX425_.jpg</p>
           <p>This is what most RAM modules will look like the metal part around the module is a heat spreader.</p>
           <h2>The Motherboard</h2>
           <p>The motherboard is the main circut that ties everything together where there is connecters</p>
           <p>and places to slot the parts into.</p>
           <img src="Motherboard.jpg"> 
           <p style="color:red; text-decoration: underline">https://images10.newegg.com/NeweggImage/ProductImageCompressAll1280/13-119-017-V01.jpg</p>
           <p>Not all motherboards look the same because some are marketed towards gamers and other things and different</p>
           <p>motherboards have a different socket on them depending on what kind of CPU is supposed to put into it.</p>
